In this amusing game, your goal is to escape from a giant bee. Your journey won't be easy as you'll encounter numerous obstacles and enemies. Only the best players will be able to unlock the Chest of Dreams and claim the well-deserved reward!

### Controls:

- **Jump:** Spacebar
- **Shoot:** Left Mouse Button (LMB) or Left CTRL
- **Pause:** Escape (ESC)

The giant bee can catch you immediately, or you may lose before it reaches you. You have a health bar that can deplete before reaching your goal, but you're not defenseless! You can evade obstacles and shoot enemies. Defeating enemies rewards you with items like coins, keys, or healing flasks. Coins can be used to purchase the Chest of Dreams, while keys are used to open it. The reward can change your life and bring happiness. You also have the option to reset your progress, although you won't want to!
